# Background
### How does someone's life experience affect their music?
Many factors in a person's life might influence what kind of music they create, but many are subjective and difficult to find (like individual personal factors/experiences/feelings).
For this exploratory analysis a few ubiquitous factors were chosen for a zoomed-out view of the relationship between personal situation and musical attributes.
