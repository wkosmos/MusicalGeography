# Background
### How does someone's life experience affect their music?
Many factors in a person's life might influence what kind of music they create, but many are subjective and difficult to find (like individual personal factors/experiences/feelings).
For this exploratory analysis a few ubiquitous factors were chosen for a zoomed-out view of the relationship between personal situation and musical attributes.

# Data

## Acquisition

## Exploration

## Cleaning/Organization
checking if any artists were outliers in num of songs or on other metrics

# Analysis

## Spotify Metrics
spotify metrics by genre
testing intuition of energy, danceability, valence:
energy vs tempo, loudness
danceability vs tempo, loudness, 
valence vs tempo, loudness
energy, valence, danceability vs each other


## Artist Birthplace

## Choice of compelling metrics

# Discussion

## Conclusion

## Notes

## Future Plans
