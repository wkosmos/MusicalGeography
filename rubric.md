#### Repo Organization and Commit History:
3. scripts in src, jupyter notebooks in notebooks, data, images, and other files similarly organized and 5+ commits.

#### Use of Scripts/Notebooks:
3. Perhaps some EDA presented in notebooks, but data acquisition, cleaning, and important analyses in scripts.

#### Object-oriented programming:
2. In functions
3. Appropriate use of classes

#### Code Style:
3. Good variable/function/class names, if name == 'main' block, appropriate documentation, would perfectly pass a pycodestyle test.

#### Coding effort (in scripts):
3. /> 150 lines of code

### Presentation 

#### Project Question/Goal:
2. Clearly stated with gusto.

#### Description of Raw Data:
2. Source described, walk through exemplary features and rows, appropriate tables/screenshots.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis:
3. Documentation of interesting relationships between the features and target, thoughtful feature engineering.

#### Analysis (pipeline, databse creation, statistical tests):
5. Clearly explained with no/few errors, impressive effort.
   
#### README:
3. Beautiful and an impressive showcase for the project with good organization, appropriate use of text and illustrations, and helpful references.
